Welcome to my YouTube application! This project showcases my skills in ReactJS and Material-UI while integrating with the YouTube Data API to fetch and display channel and video information.

Skills Demonstrated:
React Development: Built responsive and interactive UI components using React.

API Integration: Connected with the YouTube Data API to fetch channel and video data.

Material-UI Styling: Implemented consistent design and styles using MUI components.

React Router Navigation: Managed routing for different sections of the application.


Feel free to explore the codebase, contribute, or use this project as a learning resource for React-based frontend development integrated with external APIs.
